“Esquivel did most of the talking. He said Theranos was suing three former employees for stealing its intellectual property. Their names were Michael O’Connell, Chris Todd, and John Howard. Howard had overseen all research and development and interviewed Ed before he was hired. Todd was Ed’s predecessor and had led the design of the 1.0 prototype. And O’Connell was an employee who had worked on the 1.0 cartridge until he left the previous summer.
No one was to have any contact with them going forward and all emails and documents must be preserved, Esquivel instructed. He would be conducting a thorough investigation to gather evidence with the assistance of Wilson Sonsini. Then he added something that sent a jolt through the room.”
