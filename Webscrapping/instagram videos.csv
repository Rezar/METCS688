291,Bn06NuNh2C8,2018-09-17 12-47-21,,⭐Bench Pressing ⭐ Heres some more footage 🎥 from Saturdays Bench Pressing 🏋️‍♀️ Everyone in the video is a very strong at the movement 💪 but what is most interesting to note possibly just for lifting geeks like us 🤓😬 is the range of different styles From wide grip ⬅️➡️ to narrow grip ➡️⬅️ small arch to big arch foot position 👣 and so on More than anything this goes to show that you need to find a style that suits you and your strengths 🏅 For example a wider grip ⬅️➡️ tends to favour those stronger in the pecs and a close grip ➡️⬅️ people who are more tricep dominant A wider foot position 👟 helps those who have trouble keeping their bum 🍑 on the bench do so but sometimes at the expense of leg drive yep thats right if you bench press properly your legs are involved in the movement 😲 Regardless of what style suits you best there are a few fundamentals 🏗️ that everyone in the video has in common that ensures they have really good technique 👌 and get the most out of the lift ✔️Eyes under the bar when setting up 👀 🔹This ensures you have good clearance from the hooks when the bar is lifted out and you are benching ✔️Shoulder blades pulled back down 🔹This helps create an arch in your back something that is very good for shoulder health 🏥 and essentially puts you in as strong 💪 and as safe 🛡️ a position as possible ✔️Foot position 👣 🔹Feet hips are pulled back to shorten the distance between them and the shoulders The feet are also driven into the ground and do not move This helps to create the arch and to set a strong and stable base 🏛️ to press from ✔️A full range of motion 🏋️‍♀️ 🔹The bar touches the chest around sternum area and is pressed slightly backwards towards the face on the way up until the elbows are locked Its well documented in the research 📖 that a full range of motion yields the best results ✔️ Alligment of elbows under the wrists 🔹Again this puts you in the strongest 💪 and safest 🛡️ position allowing you to get the most out of the lift ✔️ Breathing 🌬️ 🔹 Big breath of air at the top of each rep and breathing out just past the sticking point,552725738270459,55.8551675501,-4.2746841999,0,UNK,UNK,20.33,UNK,-1,UNK,
